# Resume

This is the directory for a selection of finished or mostly-finished projects that highlight skills I have acquired.

Current contents (planned):

- RevBayes Project
- Health Data Project
- JS test

## Jupyter Processing Checklist

**Languages Used:** Python, SQL, BQ API

ReadMe.md : Includes Colab link for the default file + Colab 

- Empty default Jupyter processing checklist
- Example Processing Checklist on CSV
- Example Processing Checklist on SQL
- Example Processing Checklist with BigQuery API input

## Some ML Tutorial Thing

**Languages Used:** Python

Jupyter


## MySQL + ERN + D3 Test Case

**Languages Used:** JavaScript, SQL

MySQL/Node/Express/d3js/React

Followed tutorials to attatch D3 and Express with MySQL on the back-end, and a separate tutorial for d3js with Node and React on the front-end. Then mixed it.


Subprojects:

- d3nodevis
    - Tutorial: ???
    - Express/D3/MySQL integration
    - MySQL 5.7 possibly works? (test?)
        - Breaks with MySQL 6, because they adamantly refuse to offer a viable mechanism to SQL-ize a csv. (Yes, I tried messing with the cnf file permissions; didn't help.)
        - If you need to downgrade to run it, MySQL makes that a bit painful. For instructions, see: Notesname
- ReactProjects/my-d3-app
    - [D3 and React tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-d3-and-react-c7da74a5bd9f/)
        - (Painful to copy-paste; rely on notes for reusability)

(...is PostgreSQL going to be easier for this? Not sure.)

## Bayesian MCMC with RevBayes

Using Bayesian MCMC to infer Phylogenetic Trees from Genomic Sequence Data

**Languages Used:** RevBayes (specialized language; inspired by R and BUGS, R-like syntax)

An old school project on genomics data.
