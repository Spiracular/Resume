# Resume

This is the directory for a selection of finished or mostly-finished projects that highlight skills I have acquired.

Current contents (planned):

- RevBayes Project
- Health Data Project
- JS test

## Jupyter Processing Checklist

**Languages Used:** Python, SQL, BQ API

ReadMe.md : Includes Colab link for the default file + Colab 

- Empty default Jupyter processing checklist
- Example Processing Checklist on CSV
- Example Processing Checklist on MySQL
- Example Processing Checklist with BigQuery API input

## Some ML Tutorial Thing

**Languages Used:** Python

Jupyter


## MERN Test Case

**Languages Used:** JavaScript

MySQL OR MondoDB, Node/Express/React

(No mixing React and D3js; D3 relies on refs, and is not very compatible with React's DOM paradigm)

Subprojects:

- MySQL 5.7 possibly works? (test?)
    - Breaks with MySQL 6, because they adamantly refuse to offer a viable mechanism to SQL-ize a csv. (Yes, I tried messing with the cnf file permissions; didn't help.)
    - If you need to downgrade to run it, MySQL makes that a bit painful. For instructions, see: Notesname

...oh no. Mac is giving me issues with setting up MongoDB.

Do this? https://zellwk.com/blog/install-mongodb/ (That worked! Use brew.)

(...is PostgreSQL going to be easier for this? Not sure.)

## Bayesian MCMC with RevBayes

Using Bayesian MCMC to infer Phylogenetic Trees from Genomic Sequence Data

**Languages Used:** RevBayes (specialized language; inspired by R and BUGS, R-like syntax)

An old school project on genomics data.
